A simple multi-user chatroom using MySQL or SQLite to manage users and messages. Must have either a SQLite database file or MySQL installed with a database name USERS created.

If running the python file directly, first install SQLite or mysql.connector (based on the version being used)

```
pip install mysql-connector-python
```
```
pip install db-sqlite3
```
